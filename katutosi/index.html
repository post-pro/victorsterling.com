        <h1> 勝利 </h1>

        <p>
        pronounced <i>しょうり (shouri)</i>, this is the japanese word for victory. with an additional character (者), it makes 勝利者 which means victor. names in japanese are often written in kanji, and sometimes they are made up of normal words. although they may be written with a regular word they often have completely different pronunciations, and any given writing of a name can have many valid pronunciations. for example, 勝利 can be pronounced あきとし (akitoshi), かつとし (katsutoshi), すぐり (suguri), まさと (masato), or まさとし (masatoshi).

        <p>
        i chose the pronunciation かつとし (katsutoshi) for my username. the standard method of typing japanese on a keyboard involves typing in what mirrors pronunciation of the word with english letters. because it wasn't made for english speakers to use, there are many different shortcuts to make it easier for japanese people to type. for example you can type 'tu' instead of 'tsu', 'ti' instead of 'chi', or 'si' instead of 'shi'. because of this, the normal way to input かつとし is 'katutosi'. this is where my username comes from.
