        q: why is all the text pink?
        </p>
        <p>
        a: it's my favorite color. the exact tone of pink used in the text on this site is called baker-miller pink. it's hex code is #FF91AF (i&nbsp;have this memorized). some history on why it has this name: in the 70s a scientist named alexander schauss was researching physiological responses to color. he discovered that this particular shade of pink had the most profound effect in lowering heart rate and calming whoever was looking at it. he then convinced the directors of a naval correctional facility to paint the walls of some prison confinement in the color, to see what effect it had on the prisoners. he named the color after the two directors of the facility, baker and miller. at the facility it was reported that "since the initiation of this procedure on 1 march 1979, there have been no incidents of erratic or hostile behavior during the initial phase of confinement."

        q: why do you not use any capital letters?
        </p>
        <p>
        a: i think capital letters are an abomination. we already use periods to mark new sentences, so capitalizing the first word in a sentence isn't really necessary. i prefer the uniformity provided by all of the letters being in the same case. i am also fine with all-caps, but i didn't use it for this site because i think that would come across as too aggressive.

        if you have any other questions please email me and if i think it is good i'll add it to the site.
